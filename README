This repo contains a basic autograder.

 
It basically moves all the files into the source folder.
Then it compiles and runs Autograder.java which checks
for existance, compilation and checkstyle compliance.
It also runs a set of diff tests for each program.
It takes arguments in pairs: programName #ofDiffTests
For autograder to run it must have at least one file to
run and test
